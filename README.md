# DeskMaster

DeskMaster is a custom component for ESPHome to control an Uplift (or similar) motorized standing desk

## Background

This project is a fork of the [desky](https://github.com/ssieb/custom_components/tree/master/components/desky) component by [@ssieb](https://github.com/ssieb).
I wanted to add extra features and scope creep well outside of that of of Desky so I created this (fork) project
